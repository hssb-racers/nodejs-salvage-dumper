# nodejs-salvage-dumper

This simple websocket client for the RACErs Ledger is a proof of concept to dump the salvage events salvaged and destroyed values to two textfiles in the current working directory.

## Requirements

This requires, that the ledger runs on port 8029, hence the regular version cannot be used at the time of writing.

The modified version is available only from klaernie directly.

Furthermore a working nodejs installation is required.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to a location of your choosing.
2. Execute `npm install`.

Afterwards you can start the game and then start the dumper with `nodejs index.js`.
